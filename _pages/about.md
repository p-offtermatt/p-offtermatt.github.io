I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/">Université de Sherbrooke</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute</a> for Software Systems in Saarbrücken, under co-supervision by 
<a href="http://info.usherbrooke.ca/mblondin/">Michael Blondin</a> and <a href="https://fmazowiecki.github.io/">Filip Mazowiecki</a>.

My current research focus is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a>, particularly of infinite-state systems.
The overarching goal is to enable development of more
robust systems. For example, verification can help developers ensure a system meets specifications
before, during and after deployment, even if these specifications are hard to check
manually or by testing.

Personally, I also have interests in the Internet-of-Things and artificial intelligence.

I got my Bachelor's (2018) and Master's (2019) in Informatics from the <a href="http://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a>,
and I was part of the <a href="https://paves.model.in.tum.de/">PaVeS</a> research group as a student assistant.
My master's thesis was supervised by <a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/people/detail/index.php?id=people.detail&arg=163">Christoph Welzel</a>.
